"""Whether a version satisfies a range, the way npm's caret and tilde ranges read."""


def satisfies(version: str, spec: str) -> bool:
    """Whether ``version`` (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, digits only, or with a pre-release after "-") is in ``spec``.

    A spec is comparator sets joined by ``||`` (either one); a set is comparators separated by spaces (all of
    them). A comparator is one of:

    - ``=1.2.3`` or ``1.2.3``, ``>1.2.3``, ``>=1.2.3``, ``<1.2.3``, ``<=1.2.3``;
    - ``^1.2.3``: >=1.2.3 <2.0.0; ``^0.2.3``: >=0.2.3 <0.3.0; ``^0.0.3``: >=0.0.3 <0.0.4;
    - ``~1.2.3``: >=1.2.3 <1.3.0; ``~1.2``: >=1.2.0 <1.3.0; ``~1``: >=1.0.0 <2.0.0;
    - ``1.2.x`` or ``1.2.*``: >=1.2.0 <1.3.0; ``1.x``: >=1.0.0 <2.0.0; ``*`` or ``x`` or an empty set: any version.

    A version with a pre-release (``1.2.3-beta``) satisfies only a set in which some comparator names the same
    MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH with a pre-release, and then compares by SemVer precedence (``1.2.3-alpha`` < ``1.2.3-beta``
    < ``1.2.3``). Whitespace around ``||`` and between comparators is ignored. A malformed version or spec raises
    ValueError.
